				The sweet-spot between pretentious luxury good and disposable plastic garbage.
				It is the perfectly optimized archetype of a click-action ballpoint pen with a solid body made from metal
				and a no-frills Bauhaus design. Combined with a Schneider 755 M refill, which writes more smoothly
				than anythin else out there, this pen nears perfection.
